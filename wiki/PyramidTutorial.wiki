= Introduction =

This is a tutorial on getting the basic tutorial code for Pyramid running on appengine.
Its a very manual process for now. Paster templates to create the project will come later.


= Details =

First step is follow the steps in http://docs.pylonshq.com/pyramid/dev/narr/install.html#installing-pyramid-on-a-unix-system

*Remember that appengine runs python2.5.x (don't even attempt using anything else) so anywhere its says python2.6 in the tutorials use 2.5) *
