= Introduction =

This is a tutorial on getting the basic tutorial code for Pyramid running on appengine.
Its a very manual process for now. Paster templates to create the project will come later.


= Details =

To do the setup I am going to use a buildout recipe.

timh@chrome:~$ mkdir tut1
timh@chrome:~$ cd tut1
timh@chrome:~/tut1$ virtualenv --no-site-packages --python=/usr/bin/python2.5 .
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python2.5
New python executable in ./bin/python2.5
Also creating executable in ./bin/python
Installing setuptools............done.
timh@chrome:~/tut1$ source bin/activate
(tut1)timh@chrome:~/tut1$ bin/easy_install appfy.recipe.gae
